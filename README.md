\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

So far, no external depedencies

## Extension Settings

- Plan to add the 'content' of the markdown file to a template file.

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
- `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

The new file is created under the root of the workspace instead of current/spefied folder

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1 (Development)

- Creates a new markdown file with hardcoded content at the root of the workspace
